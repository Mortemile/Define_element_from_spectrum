# Define_element_from_spectrum

This code will help you find the peaks on the spectrum and determine what kind of element it is by the wavelength. 
The code is designed to determine the elements of impurities in the visible range for spherical tokamaks of a certain configuration (for example, Globus-M2).

In the file spectrum.txt locates dependence of radiation intensity on wavelength. Put your spectrum here and run main.py.
